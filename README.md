# ReactiveXperience

## React.JS History
Current version of React.JS is 18.2.0 (June 14, 2022).

Initial Release to the Public (V0.3.0) was in July 2013.

React.JS was first used in 2011 for Facebook's Newsfeed feature.

Facebook Software Engineer, Jordan Walke, created it.

Current version of create-react-app is v5.0.1 (Apr 13, 2022).

create-react-app includes built tools such as webpack, Babel, and ESLint.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


# Setup: Local Development Environment

This setup requires more work but allows you to complete the tutorial using an editor of your choice. Here are the steps to follow:

Make sure you have a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
Follow the [installation instructions for Create React App](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to make a new project.

##  Check Node.js and NPM Version
```
node -v
```
v18.16.0

```
npm -v
```
9.6.7


## [Install yarn via npm](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)
It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system.

Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:

```
npm install --global yarn
```
 
Check installation
Check that Yarn is installed by running:

```
yarn --version
```
1.22.19


# Getting Started with Create React App

```
npx create-react-app webapp --template typescript
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
